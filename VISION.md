# NUNit Docs Vision

The NUnit docs site is a project within the NUnit organization.

Its vision is to make it easier for NUnit's community to better understand and connect with NUnit's projects. The docs, in order to be successful, must be more than a hosting place for the separate projects' information. They must be a uniform and holistic journey for users to navigate the ecosystem and be confident that they understand things.

## Stakeholders / Collaborators

The docs project supports and collaborates with the other NUnit projects and their respective leads -- for reference, those are currently:

| Project | Lead |
| ------- | ---- |
| Framework | @rprouse|
| Console and Engine | @ChrisMaddock |
| VS Adapters and Test Generator| @OsirisTerje|
| NUnit Analyzers| @mikkelbu |
